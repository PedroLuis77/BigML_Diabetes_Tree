# BigML_Diabetes_Tree
Python algorythm which predicts diabetes cases on women of 21 and above.
The CSV file provide information from the algorithm which indicates how the different fields are relevant to verify if they have diabetes or not. In this case, glucose is obviously the most important one and that determines that our A.I algorithm is in the good path.
The BigML_Tree is an example of supervised training, showing how many decisions the algorithm can take to determine accurately if they have diabetes or not.
The Diabetes Tree Code is a Python code for everyone to modify or see how the A.I algorithm determines how to verify the diabetes.
